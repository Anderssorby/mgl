## Overview

MGL is a Common Lisp machine learning library by [Gábor
Melis](http://quotenil.com) with some parts originally contributed
by Ravenpack International. It implements:

- Backpropagation networks (BPN)- Dropout

    - Rectified linear units

    - Maxout

    - Max-channel

- Boltzmann Machines

- Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

- Deep Belief Networks (DBN)

- Semi Restricted Boltzmann Machines

- Boltzmann Machines

- Unrolling DBN to a BPN

- Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning

- Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) learning

- Gradient descent optimization

- Nesterov momentum

- Conjugate gradient optimization

- Gaussian Processes

- Optimizing Gaussian Processes as BPNs


### Features

In general, the focus is on power and performance not on ease of use.
For example, it's possible to:

- control the order of presentation of training examples,

- vary learning rate depending on time, state of the trainer object,

- track all kinds of statistics during training,
etc.

Perhaps one day there will be a cookie cutter interface with
restricted functionality if a reasonable compromise is found between
power and utility.

### Dependencies

MGL used to rely on [LLA](https://github.com/tpapp/lla) to
interface to BLAS and LAPACK. That's mostly history by now, but
configuration of foreign libraries is still done via LLA. See the
README in LLA on how to set things up. Note that these days OpenBLAS
is easier to set up and just as fast as ATLAS.

[CL-CUDA](https://github.com/takagi/cl-cuda) is a dependency for
which the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit needs to be installed, but MGL is
fully functional even if there is no cuda capable gpu installed. See
the MGL-MAT:WITH-CUDA\* macro for how to use it.

### Tests

Run the built in tests 
with:

    (ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP '#:MGL)

Note, that most of the tests are rather stochastic and can fail once
in a while.

### Bundled Software

With [MGL-PAX](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax) and
[MGL-MAT](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-mat) libraries split off
there remains only a single library bundled with MGL which does
not depend on the rest of MGL:

- MGL-GNUPLOT, a plotting library.

There is also MGL-VISUALS which does depend on MGL.

See the [MGL Manual](doc/md/manual.md) for more.
