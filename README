## Overview

MGL is a Common Lisp machine learning library by [Gábor
Melis](http://quotenil.com) with some parts originally contributed
by Ravenpack International. It mainly concentrates on various forms
of neural networks (boltzmann machines, feed-forward and recurrent
backprop nets). Most of MGL is built on top of MGL-MAT so it has
BLAS and CUDA support.

In general, the focus is on power and performance not on ease of
use. Perhaps one day there will be a cookie cutter interface with
restricted functionality if a reasonable compromise is found between
power and utility.
