Common Lisp machine learning library by Gabor Melis with some parts
contributed by Ravenpack International. Implements:
- Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks
- Semi Restricted Boltzmann Machines
- Boltzmann Machines
- Backprop networks
- Unrolling DBN to backrop network
- Contrastive Divergence, Persistent Contrastive Divergence
- Gradient descent optimization
- Conjugate gradient optimization
- Gaussian Processes

mgl-gnuplot, a plotting library, that does not depend on the rest of
the code is bundled.

MGL is under the MIT licence. See COPYING.


* Tests

Run the built in tests with:

  (ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP '#:MGL)

Note, that most of the tests are rather stochastic and can fail once
in a while.


* BLAS

MGL uses on LLA (https://github.com/tpapp/lla) to interface to BLAS
and LAPACK. See the README in LLA on how to set things up.
