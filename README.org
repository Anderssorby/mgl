MGL

Common Lisp machine learning library by [[http://quotenil.com][GÃ¡bor Melis]] with some parts
contributed by Ravenpack International. It implements:
- Backpropagation networks (BPN)
- Boltzmann Machines
  - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
  - Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
  - Semi Restricted Boltzmann Machines
  - Boltzmann Machines
  - Unrolling DBN to a BPN
  - Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning
  - Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) learning
- Gradient descent optimization
- Conjugate gradient optimization
- Gaussian Processes

mgl-gnuplot, a plotting library, that does not depend on the rest of
the code is bundled.

MGL is under the MIT licence. See COPYING.

* Features

In general, the focus is on power and performance not on ease of use.
For example, it's possible to:
- control the order of presentation of training examples,
- vary learning rate depending on time, state of the trainer object,
- track all kinds of statistics during training,
etc.

Perhaps one day there will be a cookie cutter interface with
restricted functionality if a reasonable compromise is found between
power and utility.

* Tests

Run the built in tests with:

  (ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP '#:MGL)

Note, that most of the tests are rather stochastic and can fail once
in a while.


* BLAS

MGL uses on [[https://github.com/tpapp/lla][LLA]] to interface to BLAS and LAPACK. See the README in LLA
on how to set things up.
