## 2 Overview

MGL is a Common Lisp machine learning library by [Gábor
Melis](http://quotenil.com) with some parts originally contributed
by Ravenpack International. It implements:

- Gradient descent optimization

    - Nesterov momentum

- Conjugate gradient optimization

- Backpropagation networks (BPN)

    - Dropout

    - Rectified linear units

    - Maxout

    - Max-channel

- Boltzmann Machines

    - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

    - Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning

    - Deep Belief Networks (DBN)

    - Semi Restricted Boltzmann Machines

    - Deep Boltzmann Machines

    - Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) learning

    - Unrolling DBN or a DBM to a BPN

- Gaussian Processes

    - Optimizing Gaussian Processes as BPNs

In general, the focus is on power and performance not on ease of
use. Perhaps one day there will be a cookie cutter interface with
restricted functionality if a reasonable compromise is found between
power and utility.

### 2.1 Dependencies

MGL used to rely on [LLA](https://github.com/tpapp/lla) to
interface to BLAS and LAPACK. That's mostly history by now, but
configuration of foreign libraries is still done via `LLA`. See the
README in `LLA` on how to set things up. Note that these days OpenBLAS
is easier to set up and just as fast as ATLAS.

[CL-CUDA](https://github.com/takagi/cl-cuda) is a dependency for
which the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit needs to be installed, but MGL is
fully functional even if there is no cuda capable gpu installed. See
the `MGL-MAT:WITH-CUDA*` macro for how to use it.

### 2.2 Code Organization

MGL consists of several packages dedicated to different tasks.
For example, package `MGL-RESAMPLE` is about `@MGL-RESAMPLE` and
`MGL-GD` is about `@MGL-GD` and so on. On one hand, having many
packages makes it easier to cleanly separate API and implementation
and also to explore into a specific task. At other times, they can
be a hassle, so the [`MGL`][e0d7] package itself reexports every external
symbol found in all the other packages that make up MGL.

One exception to this rule is the bundled, but independent
`MGL-GNUPLOT` library.

The built in tests can be run with:

    (ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP '#:MGL)

Note, that most of the tests are rather stochastic and can fail once
in a while.
