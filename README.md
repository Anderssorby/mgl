## 2 Overview

MGL is a Common Lisp machine learning library by [Gábor
Melis](http://quotenil.com) with some parts originally contributed
by Ravenpack International. It implements:

- Backpropagation networks (BPN)- Dropout

    - Rectified linear units

    - Maxout

    - Max-channel

- Boltzmann Machines

- Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

- Deep Belief Networks (DBN)

- Semi Restricted Boltzmann Machines

- Boltzmann Machines

- Unrolling DBN to a BPN

- Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning

- Persistent Contrastive Divergence (PCD) learning

- Gradient descent optimization

- Nesterov momentum

- Conjugate gradient optimization

- Gaussian Processes

- Optimizing Gaussian Processes as BPNs

### 2.1 Features

In general, the focus is on power and performance not on ease of use.
For example, it's possible to:

- control the order of presentation of training examples,

- vary learning rate depending on time, state of the trainer object,

- track all kinds of statistics during training,
etc.

Perhaps one day there will be a cookie cutter interface with
restricted functionality if a reasonable compromise is found between
power and utility.

### 2.2 Dependencies

MGL used to rely on [LLA](https://github.com/tpapp/lla) to
interface to BLAS and LAPACK. That's mostly history by now, but
configuration of foreign libraries is still done via `LLA`. See the
README in `LLA` on how to set things up. Note that these days OpenBLAS
is easier to set up and just as fast as ATLAS.

[CL-CUDA](https://github.com/takagi/cl-cuda) is a dependency for
which the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit needs to be installed, but MGL is
fully functional even if there is no cuda capable gpu installed. See
the `MGL-MAT:WITH-CUDA*` macro for how to use it.

### 2.3 Tests

Run the built in tests 
with:

    (ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP '#:MGL)

Note, that most of the tests are rather stochastic and can fail once
in a while.

### 2.4 Bundled Software

With [MGL-PAX](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax) and
[MGL-MAT](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-mat) libraries split off
there remains only a single library bundled with MGL which does
not depend on the rest of MGL:

- `MGL-GNUPLOT`, a plotting library.

There is also MGL-VISUALS which does depend on MGL.
